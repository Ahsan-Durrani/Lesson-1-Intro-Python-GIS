# Lesson 1 - Introduction to Python-GIS

## What we have learned so far?

During the Period I we focused on understanding the basic principles in programming and learned most of the basic functionalities in Python. 
We have learned many useful and general skills on doing things in a reproducible manner using programming, 
that can help you in many ways on your future projects or job. 

Even if you would not use programming in your work in the future, 
it is extremely useful to understand the basic idea how programming and computers work as they are highly integrated into our society and part of our daily work in 
almost every field. So this is a good starting point to proceed and learn more about programming! One especially nice thing in programming is that you learn something
new and cool all the time. Even after many years of programming, you find new tricks and tools that you haven't heard of earlier that can make your life easier in many
ways. 

During this week's lesson, we will get an overview of what Python has to offer in terms of GIS and working with spatial data, and learn the basics of Geometric objects
and Geospatial Data Model.
